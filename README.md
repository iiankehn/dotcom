# This project is being discontinued
If you are visiting this project after December 25, 2025 this project has been discontinued and is being archived. We are shifting our focus to Sevan which is being hosted on Notion. The code for this project is being removed from the repo and is strictly serving as a redirect to the new site. 

## What you need to know
As of December 25, 2025 the team has decided to cease development of the iiankehn (dotcom) website in favor of publishing content directly on Notion which houses our internal processes. It provides a seamless integration from draft to post and allows us to focus on the content rather then the code. Notion provides an all in one platform to get your work organized. 

You will be redirected from iiankehn.com to iiankehn.notion.site. We are working on a more permanent solution using Notion Plus, but have not yet rolled out the changes. We thank you for your patience, and hope to see you soon!

## What happened to the code?
The code from this project has been removed from GitHub. At this time we do not have plans to release the code as a template.
