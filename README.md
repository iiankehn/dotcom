## Sevan Core Dotcom

This repository contains the source for the Sevan Core dotcom site — a **personal website for tech news, guides, reviews, and other written content**.

The project is intentionally lightweight and static-first, with a small amount of JavaScript to support:

- A shared “web database” of posts (`blog/posts.js`) used by the blog index and archive pages.
- An optional local admin panel for creating and editing posts without touching code.

### Intended use

This codebase is **primarily intended for personal use** and to power the Sevan Core site.  
It is **not designed to be a generic starter kit or template**, and is **not intended to be forked and reused for other projects**.

You are welcome to read the code for inspiration, but please build your own implementation rather than cloning this project directly.
