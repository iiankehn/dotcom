# The Sevan vNext (Beta) Project
This is the Sevan vNext (Beta) Project designed specifically for the development of iiankehn (dotcom) project. This repository contains all of the files associated with the website and is primarily intended for maintaining the website. 

## The Code
The code for this project is publicly available because GitHub requires it to be available as a public repo for GitHub Pages unless you pay for an Enterprise license. At this time I am not accepting pull or push requests for this project as its primary intent is to serve iiankehn.com (dotcom) and the content witin the website. 

At this time there are no current plans to release a product that will be publicly available to fork and use as your own. If that changes, I will make an announcement. 

## This project is not a charity
As mentioned above, this projects primary purpose is to serve the content on iiankehn.com (dotcom), use of this code for your own personal or professional use is strictly prohibitied unless otherwise granted by the author of this project. Use of the code or any of its content without persmission can/will result in legal litigation. You have been warned. 

## What you should know before visiting the website
While functionally the website is in a working state, it is not yet feature complete and may contain bugs or errors. I am working though some of the more common layout issues, but outside of that it will take some time to work out the kinks. This is an early milestone release, and will change before the final product is released.
