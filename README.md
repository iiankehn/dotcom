= The Sevan vNext (Beta) Project
This is the Sevan vNext (Beta) Project designed specifically for the development of iiankehn (dotcom) project. This repository contains all of the files associated with the website and is primarily intended for maintaining the website. 

= The Code =
The code for this project is publicly available because GitHub requires it to be available as a public repo unless you pay for an Enterprise license. I do not authorize personal or professional use without giving credit where credit is due. This project is being provided "as is" without support or warranty, so if you're having an issue with the website, all requests must go through me first. 

== This project is not a charity ==
As mentioned above, this projects primary intent is to serve the iiankehn.com (dotcom) website and nothing more. If you would like to see a general template of this project, I'd like to hear from you. Right now I am not working on a public project that you can use for your personal use as it is still under active development for my own use. Once the code is complete, I will make an update to the project, and announce a repo that you can work off of. 

I will deny all fork and pull requests that come though. Don't even bother.
