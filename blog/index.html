                We messed up
            </h1>
            <p>
                Remember when we said we were going to move everything to Notion and host all of our content over there and that is was going to be easier to push out new content? Well that kind of backfired spectactularly. Put simply, we oversold and under-delivered on our commitment to make Notion our new platform and we decided to revert back to the GitHub project instead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So here's the deal. We are putting the finishing touches on the new website, and we'll bring over the content over the course of this week. There wasn't a lot of content, so the transition should be pretty smooth. With that being said, we are revising our internal practices and will adjust accrdingly so that this mistakes like this don't happen again.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>With that out of the way, we're also announcing some new features that should be rolling out to the website right now. These changes are focused around video content, and will allow users to view content directly on the website without having to leave the page. These changes are still in development, but we're excited to share them with you soon.</p>
