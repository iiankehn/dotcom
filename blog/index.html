                TikTok was bought by a U.S. conglomerate of investors
            </h1>
            <p>While it is not quite over, the saga of TikTok is soon going to come to an end, and I am not entirely sure how I feel about it. For those of you who haven’t been paying attention. A law was passed last year to ban TikTok in the US because of foreign control from China and alleged concerns of National Security from Congress.</p> 
            <br />
            <p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonwells/trump-signs-tiktok-executive-order">This fear is not new</a>, and has been around for a while now. But when Trump took office for a second term, he signed an executive order to bring TikTok back <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-ruling-bytedance-sell-rcna187150">(after the Surpreme Court shot down a ban)</a> and vowed to find companies that would be willing to take on the burden of hosting TikTok in the US without giving China access to US data. While the intentions were sound, I suppose, I didn’t think that it was honestly worth ripping apart a platform that millions of people used every day for allegations of National Security Threats, which the government still had not provided a foundation for... <a href="../blog/archive/tiktok-was-bought.html">Read more</a></p>

                We messed up
            </h1>
            <p>Remember when we said we were going to move everything to Notion and host all of our content over there and that is was going to be easier to push out new content? Well that kind of backfired spectactularly. Put simply, we oversold and under-delivered on our commitment to make Notion our new platform and we decided to revert back to the GitHub project instead.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So here's the deal. We are putting the finishing touches on the new website, and we'll bring over the content over the course of this week. There wasn't a lot of content, so the transition should be pretty smooth. With that being said, we are revising our internal practices and will adjust accrdingly so that this mistakes like this don't happen again.</p>
            <br />
            <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mb-4">What's new</h1>
            <p>In this release we are bringing quality of life improvements to the overall experience, our main focus for this release is bringing video content directly to the website without having to leave the page. This change is actively being implemented and we are seeking feedback on the experience. It is important to note that we cannot control the experience that our partners bring with their video plugins, so please keep that in mind before submitting feedback.</p>
