        <h2>With Windows 10 hitting end of life, what now?</h2>
        <p><small>Posted on Oct 18, 2025 by Iian Kehn</small></p>
        <p>We all know that you've been dragging your feet to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, and honestly I don't blame you. Windows 11 is bloated, full of Microsoft Spyware, and just not what users want in Windows.</p>
        <p>But what if there was another way? Linux? Possibly, if your're slightly inclined. There are plenty of user friendly distros out there that would work for general users, but like with any distro, there's always a learning curve.</p>
        <p>What about ChromeOS Flex? Again, possibly. The thing about ChromeOS Flex specifically is that, unlike Neverware's cloudready, ChromeOS variant, Flex doesn't work the same way, and on all hardware. In my experience, it's weird with Nvidia graphics, and AMD processors.</p>
        <p>What about macOS? Also a good option that will cost you. A Mac Mini is a good option if you're looking for something small and affordable. But it's not Windows. There is a small learning curve, but it's not hard to get used to.</p>
        <p>So what is the best option? There isn't one. At least not without making a compromise. Windows 11 is the next best thing for Windows if you have a compatible PC. If not your options are Linux, or CHromeOS Flex, but even then, it's really going to depend on how much time you are willing to put into it, and how much you are willing to learn. If you are looking to spend money, and don't want Windows 11, a Mac may be your only other choice.</p>
