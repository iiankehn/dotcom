        <p>It's been a hot minute since there was a proper website refresh, and I have been slowly rolling out updates to the website little by little. Now before you come at me for working in Production, allow me to explain.</p>
        <p>There's not much to the current version of the website, as of right now it is just a home and about page. To make the homepage more useful, I am incorporating a news feed to show off new content posted.</p>
        <p>I will post a more detailed breakdown of the new changes when enough improvements have been made to the <a href="http://www.github.com/iiankehn/dotcom">GitHub project</a>.</p>
