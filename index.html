        <h2>Sevan vNext Release 20251018</h2>
        <p><small>Posted on Oct 18, 2025 by Iian Kehn</small></p>
        <p>The next version of Sevan vNext is live. This is the first initial release of the new codebase, so features may be missing, inaccurate, not working, or broken in this release.</p>
        <p>What's new</p>
        <p>This release features a new design system, focusing on new visuals, and emphasizing content. This release is available for both desktop and mobe out of the box and does not require additional setup. </p>
        <p>What's coming</p>
        <p>We are working on a system to feature video content without breaking the existing layout. We will be opening up a preview of this feature in a future release and are looking to generate feedback when the time comes.</p>

        <p><small>Posted on Oct 18, 2025 by Iian Kehn</small></p>
        <p>It's been a hot minute since there was a proper website refresh, and I have been slowly rolling out updates to the website little by little. Now before you come at me for working in Production, allow me to explain.</p>
        <p>There's not much to the current version of the website, as of right now it is just a home and about page. To make the homepage more useful, I am incorporating a news feed to show off new content posted.</p>
        <p>I will post a more detailed breakdown of the new changes when enough improvements have been made to the <a href="http://www.github.com/iiankehn/dotcom">GitHub project</a>.</p>
